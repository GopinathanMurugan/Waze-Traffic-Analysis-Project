## Overview
This comprehensive report explores Waze traffic data to identify patterns in congestion, traffic incidents, and user-reported events. The findings aim to optimize urban traffic management and enhance road safety through actionable insights.

---

## Objective
- Analyze Waze traffic data to uncover key trends and patterns in urban mobility.
- Investigate the influence of traffic incidents and congestion on travel times.
- Evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of user-reported events.
- Develop predictive models to forecast traffic conditions.
- Provide recommendations to improve traffic flow and reduce delays.

---

## Data Source
- **Dataset Composition:**
  - The dataset includes traffic event records reported via the Waze app.
  - Features include event types, timestamps, locations, and severity levels.
- **Key Data Columns:**
  - Event Metrics: Incident type, severity, duration, and affected road segments.
  - Spatial Data: GPS coordinates and road names.
  - Temporal Data: Timestamps for event reporting and resolution.
- **Collection Method:**
  - Aggregated from Waze's public API, which gathers data from app users.

## Data Cleaning
Steps to prepare the dataset for analysis:
1. **Missing Value Management:**
   - Identified and imputed missing entries in event severity and duration.
   - Removed records with incomplete location data.
2. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Flagged and handled anomalies in event duration and severity scores using statistical methods.
3. **Data Type Standardization:**
   - Converted timestamps to uniform datetime formats.
   - Standardized categorical fields like incident types.
4. **Spatial Data Validation:**
   - Ensured GPS coordinates matched known road networks.
   - Cross-referenced road names with external mapping data.
5. **Duplicate Records:**
   - Eliminated duplicate events logged in close temporal and spatial proximity.
6. **Severity Normalization:**
   - Rescaled severity scores for consistent interpretation across analyses.
7. **Event Categorization:**
   - Grouped similar incident types into broader categories for clarity.
8. **Geospatial Clustering:**
   - Clustered events geographically to identify hotspots.
9. **Noise Removal:**
   - Filtered out low-confidence user reports and false positives.
10. **Final Validation:**
   - Conducted audits to verify data accuracy and completeness.
